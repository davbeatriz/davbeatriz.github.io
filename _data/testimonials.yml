  description: My adolescence was marked with bad acne unfortunately. I suffered with a lack of confidence and felt generally down because of it.
               With only three sessions with Betty, my acne scars have almost entirely disappeared
               and I'm finally beginning to feel my old confident self again. Thank you!

  description: New to the  area, I found this spa via a coupon mailer. I have received a package of 3 facial peels with wonderful results! The two sisters practice together and are so knowledgeable and nice. Each time I have called and attended an appointment, they have  treated me as if I were also a sister. My menopausal skin responded great to the peels received and I plan to have other procedures done, as well.
