  description: Lasers can selectively target a pigmented hair while leaving the surrounding skin undamaged. Each dime sized pulse of laser energy takes a fraction of a second and can treat many hairs at the same time. Compared with electrolysis, laser hair removal is more precise and much faster. Small areas such as the upper lip can be treated in less than a minute, while large areas (back, legs) may need up to an hour.

  title: Tattoo Removal
  description: Lasers are the most common method of tattoo removal performed today. Tattoos consist of thousands of particles of tattoo ink suspended in the skin. The normal human immune system typically removes small foreign particles from the skin. Tattoo ink particles are too big to be removed by this system and are thus considered permanent. The use of lasers helps to break up these particles into smaller pieces that can be removed by the immune system.
